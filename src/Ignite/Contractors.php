                <h2 class="underline-left pb-3"><span>Payroll Information</span></h2>
                <p>Ignite uses the Astute payroll system. On commencement of your first assignment you will receive an email with your login details. If you have not received this, please check your junk/spam email. If still not received then contact your account manager as soon as possible.</p>
                <p class="mb-0"><strong>Just a few pointers:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Double check all details are correct before submitting your timesheet for approval.</li>
                  <li>Submit your timesheet to your supervisor before 5pm on Fridays. This gives your supervisor time to authorise before 10am on Monday following the week worked. Payments are processed on Tuesday to ensure you receive your payment on Thursday. You may receive payment before this but it is best not to rely on an early payment as there can be delays with banking processes.</li>
                  <li>You will be paid directly into your bank account each week and you will be emailed your payslip.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Be careful to enter timesheets against the correct job. If in doubt as to the status of your timesheet, you can check this by logging into the Astute payroll system</p>
