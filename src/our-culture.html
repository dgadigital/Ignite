            <p>To set our <a href="#" class="underlined">recruiters</a> up for success, over decades of operation, we have cultivated an industry-leading culture. Different thinking is encouraged and rewarded by providing an environment where employees feel supported and trusted. </p>
            <p>Internally, this provides staff with pathways to think critically and creatively. Externally, this provides our clients with deeper, more effective recruitment solutions.</p>

                <p>Our mission is to add value to clients’ businesses by connecting great talent with reputable companies. In order to attract the best talent, we need the best talent.</p>
                <p>To encourage the recruitment and retention of experienced recruiters, we have a culture that places equal value on rewarding, recognising and supporting our people.</p>
                <p>We want to ignite the potential of our people, candidates and clients, all while reimagining the future of the working world and delivering exceptional, sustainable outcomes for all our stakeholders.</p>
                <p>A key component to achieving our mission is people. Through understanding what employees need to feel valued and appreciated, we have implemented both new starter initiatives along with rewards and recognition programs.</p>
                <p>In response to <a href="#" class="underlined">changing workplace dynamics</a>, flexible work options have also been introduced to cater to new wants and needs in relation to the employee experience. Offering further benefits, such as programs dedicated to training and career progression, outlines an interest in employee development. In the modern workplace, this is proving a pivotal facet of retaining top talent.</p>
                <p>As a result of our approach to fostering a unique and personalised workplace culture, we have been certified as a <a href="#" class="underlined">Great Place To Work</a>, with <a href="#" class="underlined">93% of people saying Ignite is a great place to work</a>.</p>

                <p>Our values inform not only our culture but also our approach to recruitment solutions. By having easily identifiable and strong core values, implementation becomes second nature. Ensuring that everyone is on the same page and actively working together.</p>
                <p>At Ignite, we emphasise ingenuity, understanding, connection and courage. These values work to inform both our behaviours and operational outcomes.</p>
                <p>The importance placed on ingenuity means that we afford our people the space needed to problem solve and think outside the box to create the best fit and sustainable solutions for clients.</p>
                <p>Valuing understanding leads to a greater appreciation of the needs of our employees, clients and contractor workforce. With understanding at the fore, our practices prioritise active listening and advice-giving to achieve the best outcomes.</p>
                <p>At the heart of recruitment is connection. By placing value on developing an environment where collaboration and long-term relationships are encouraged, communication becomes deeper and more effective.</p>
                <p>With the nature of recruitment changing in order to meet industry trends, we see an integral need to value courage. By challenging norms, we encourage our employees to do things differently while achieving efficient results.</p>
                <p>Importantly, our commitment to understanding and displaying courage extends to creating equal employment opportunities. Our male-to-female ratio of 44:56 highlights our dedication to ensuring diversity and inclusion.</p>
