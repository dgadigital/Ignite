<h3>Future talent program </h3>

Our future talent service helps future-proof your resource needs and talent pipelines that you can staircase through your organisation. 


Typically, we identify a cohort of undergraduates, people transitioning careers, or people from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds and engage them in a merit-based assessment process. This cohort is then offered a bespoke training program whilst working in your technology, business or operational teams.


Beyond this training, applicable to your future business needs, you can directly employ these individuals in your business.


These people are highly talented resources of the future and will form a crucial part of your high-performing teams where you are able to leverage the positive behaviours that excel in your business. For these exercises, we can utilise our strong relationships with our training partners and align your exercises to the SFIA 8 framework.
